# MoneyTask
This application takes user input (a number between 0 and 2,000,000,000) and provides string output with English representation of this number.

#### Installation
Windows users can download .exe file from releases. Others can build application themself if needed.

#### Problem explanation
You have been asked to produce a system that takes a numerical monetary value in dollars and cents and produces its English equivalent — so that it can be printed on a physical paper receipt.
The user should be able to enter a dollars and cents amount (no currency symbols or commas are required for the input) that is less than 2 billion dollars, i.e., a number between zero and 2 billion with two decimal places.
The application will output the English words that express the number as a string of words (dollars and cents). The program should encode words exactly as you would say them in reading out the monetary amount.
For example, if the user enters 1357256.32 then the program should convert that number to a string:
one million, three hundred and fifty seven thousand, two hundred and fifty six DOLLARS AND thirty two CENTS
